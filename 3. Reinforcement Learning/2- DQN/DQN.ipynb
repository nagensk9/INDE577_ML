        "- The code implements a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent that uses the Q-learning algorithm for training. \n",
        "- The DQN agent learns to play the CartPole-v0 game by interacting with the environment, storing experiences in memory, and updating a neural network model. \n",
        "- It uses experience replay to break the correlation between consecutive samples and improve training stability. The training loop runs for a specified number of episodes, and in each episode, the agent selects actions based on an epsilon-greedy strategy, observes rewards and next states, and updates the neural network model using the Q-learning update rule. Overall, the code trains a DQN agent to play the CartPole-v0 game by combining reinforcement learning principles with deep neural networks."
