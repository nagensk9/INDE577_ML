Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of examining and understanding the data to **discover patterns, relationships, and anomalies**. Following are our main objectives of performing EDA.

* Underlying **structure of the data**, the types of variables, and their distributions.

* **Detecting outliers and extreme values**, which can be errors or unusual data points that require special attention.

* **Identify Relationships between variables**, such as correlations or causal relationships.

* **Selecting relevant features** for a predictive model, by identifying the most important variables that are highly correlated with the outcome variable.

* **identifying missing data**, outliers, and other issues that need to be addressed before building a predictive model.
